Our community is welcoming to everyone, regardless of their characteristics.

As such, we expect you to treat everyone with respect and contribute to an open and welcoming community.

DO
- have empathy and be nice to others
- be respectful of differing opinions, even if you disagree
- give and accept constructive criticism

DON'T
- use offensive or derogatory language
- troll or spam
- personally attack or harass others

Repetitive violations of these guidelines might get your access to the repository restricted.

If you feel like a user is violating these guidelines or feel treated unfairly, please refrain from vigilantism
and instead report the issue to a moderator! The best way is joining our [official Discord community](https://vencord.dev/discord)
and opening a modmail ticket.
