## ❓ FAQ

**Is EagleCord safe?**
Using any Discord mod is against Discord’s Terms of Service and could result in enforcement. Many users go years without issues, but you *should only use mods on accounts you can afford to lose*.

**Will I get banned for using it?**
There are no widespread reports of bans for simply using client mods, though external factors or plugin misuse may trigger enforcement. Stay aware and don’t advertise mod use.
