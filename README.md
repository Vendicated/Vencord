# PawsomeVencord

## Note, this is an unofficial fork of Vencord. This repo might be behind the main repo at times.

- Not to mention that this fork is pretty much only being maintained by 2 people LOL

The cutest Discord client mod

## Features

-   Super easy to install (Download Installer, open, click install button, done)
-   100+ plugins built in: [See a list](https://vencord.dev/plugins) (This list does not represent the current plugin list, it will only show the native vencord plugins)
    -   Some highlights: SpotifyControls, MessageLogger, Experiments, GameActivityToggle, Translate, NoTrack, QuickReply, Free Emotes/Stickers, PermissionsViewer, CustomCommands, ShowHiddenChannels, PronounDB
-   Fairly lightweight despite the many inbuilt plugins
-   ~~Excellent Browser Support: Run Vencord in your Browser via extension or UserScript~~
-   Works on any Discord branch: Stable, Canary or PTB all work (though for the best experience I recommend stable!)
-   Custom CSS and Themes: Inbuilt css editor with support to import any css files (including BetterDiscord themes)
-   Privacy friendly, blocks Discord analytics & crash reporting out of the box and has no telemetry
-   Maintained very actively, broken plugins are usually fixed within 12 hours (sometimes longer due to being a fork, and discord actively changing their app)
-   Settings sync: Keep your plugins and their settings synchronised between devices / apps (optional)

<details>
<summary>Using Vencord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Vencord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Vencord in a server where you might get banned for it
