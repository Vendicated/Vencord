# Vencord
This is my Vencord setup, including my userplugins. The userplugins are submodules, so you should clone this repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ghostpia/Vencord.git` in order to automatically initialise them.
This is a developer build of Vencord. For instructions on building, please use [this](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) guide!
