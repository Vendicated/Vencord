# Vencord

My own Discord Desktop mod :)

## Features

- Works on Discord's latest swc update that breaks all other mods
- Proper context isolation -> Works in newer Electron versions (Confirmed working on versions 13-21)
- Inline patches: Patch Discord's code with regex replacements! See [the experiments plugin](src/plugins/experiments.ts) for an example. While being more complex, this is more powerful than monkey patching since you can patch only small parts of functions instead of fully replacing them, access non exported/local variables and even replace constants (like in the aforementioned experiments patch!)
- Experiments
- Custom Css: Manually edit `%appdata%/Vencord/settings/quickCss.css` / `~/.config/Vencord/settings/quickCss.css` with your favourite editor and the client will automatically apply your changes
- Many Useful™ plugins - [List](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/tree/main/src/plugins)

## Installing

Make sure you have NodeJs and git installed. I will be using pnpm, you can use npm instead
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord
cd Vencord
pnpm i
pnpm build
```
The builds are now in the dist/ folder (Vencord/dist).
Now install with either the powershell/bash script or use [X1nto's installer](https://github.com/X1nto/VencordInstaller/releases/latest)
