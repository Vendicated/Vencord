# BypassDND

Bypass DND allows you to set specific guilds/channels/users to still receive a notification from when in DND mode.
You will only get the notification if:

-   The message is pinging you (for guild and channel bypasses, or users too if `allowOutsideOfDms` is enabled)
-   All messages in DMs
