## What is this?

This is a third-party-plugin for [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) that logs messages, images, and ghost pings in Discord.
The plugin saves messages to a json file, and can restore them after reloading Discord.

## Features

-   Restore deleted and edited messages even after reloading Discord (optional).
-   Log messages from channels or DMs you haven't opened.
-   Save deleted images
-   View logs in a modal that shows your logged messages.
    -   Sort messages based on timestamps.
    -   Search logs by channel ID, user ID, server ID, and message ID.
    -   Ghost Pinged tab to track and view ghost pings.
-   Set a message limit to manage the number of saved logs (settings).
-   Blacklist servers, channels, and users to prevent logging specific content.
-   Whitelist feature to selectively allow logging for specific servers, channels, or users.
-   Whitelist overrides server blacklist, allowing logging of whitelisted users' actions in blacklisted servers and channels.
-   Export logs for backup and analysis purposes.
-   Import logs to restore previous logging data.

> [!NOTE]
> The "Cache Messages From Servers" Option basically treats all servers as whitelisted if its not blacklisted. If you have a lot of servers, this can cause a lot of messages to be logged.
