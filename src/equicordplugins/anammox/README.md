# Anammox

Removes Nitro-exclusive stuff from various places:

- The shops above private chats
- The gift button in the chat box
- The "billing" section in settings

While this can be done with css, a plugin is able to do it much more thorougly — for example, the shops are still accessible via keyboard navigation.
