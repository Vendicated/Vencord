## 📦 What is Stalcord?

Stalcord is a plugin for Vencordthat allows you to **monitor a specific user's activity** across servers and DMs. It sends a **native notification** whenever the chosen user sends a message in any server or direct message where you're both present.

It may be kinda creepy to use so please use it responsibly and don't use it to harras folks.

## ⚙️ Settings

You can configure the plugin via the Vencord settings UI:

- **User ID to monitor** 
- **Notify for DMs**
