# QuickSnip
QuickSnip is the go-to tool for sharing customizable preset snippets in direct messages and channels with ease. 

## Ease of access
A simple chatbar icon opens a modal with the preset buttons, making it effortless to access and use.

## Dynamic Text Replacement
QuickSnip allows for simple yet powerful text replacements:
- ${userName}: Inserts the recipient's name (works exclusively in DMs).
- ${myName}: Automatically includes your username.

This makes every snippet feel personal and contextually relevant.

## Optional Auto-Send

QuickSnip also offers the flexibility to auto-send snippets with a single click. While this feature is off by default, it's perfect for quick, repetitive responses.
