# Hide Message

Hide a message without blocking the user.

Ever saw a message and thought, "I don't want to block this person, but I just
don't want to see this particular thing on my screen right now"? I know I have.
Now you can!

Right click a message and click the "👁 Hide" button, and it will be hidden just
like if you had blocked the author. But it _only_ hides that message.
