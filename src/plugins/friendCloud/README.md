# FriendCloud

Visualize the users you interact with most in a cloud!

Simply run the `/friendcloud` command to generate a cloud of your friends based on your interactions with them.

Use the `count` option to set the number of users to display. Use the `algorithm` option to choose the algorithm; Discord has two versions of the store (default is `v2`).
