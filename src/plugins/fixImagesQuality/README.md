# Fix Images Quality

Improves quality of images by loading them at their original resolution

### The default behaviour is the following

- In chat, optimised but full resolution images will be loaded.
- In the image modal, the original image will be loaded.

You can also enable original image in chat via the plugin settings, but this may cause performance issues!

This plugin does not change how others see your images!
