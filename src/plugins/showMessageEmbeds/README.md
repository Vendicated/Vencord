# ShowMessageEmbeds

Adds a context menu option to show embeds for links that don't have one.

Right click on the link and select "Show Embed" to use.

The new embed is only visible locally, allowing you to view embeds of links sent by users that don't have embed permissions or surrounded the link with < > in their message.
