⚠️ This plugin is still **work in progress (WIP)**.

**QuestComplete** is a Vencord plugin that adds a **“Spoof”** button to the **Quests tab** in Discord, allowing you to complete quests without having to install or launch games/apps manually, also complete video quests fatser before video ends.
