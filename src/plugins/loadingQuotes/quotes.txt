I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
You're doing good today!
Don't worry, it's nothing 9 cups of coffee couldn't solve!

Welcome to nginx!
Loading... because good things take time
Packing all the cool stuff for you
Our servers are doing push-ups. Almost there
Loading... probably just to annoy you
Do robots dream of loading screens ?
Cooking up some pixels... medium rare
Loading... because we enjoy watching you wait
Taking a coffee break. Back in 5 minutes
Loading... or are we ?
Tying shoelaces... on a caterpillar
Why rush? The loading screen is the real content
Sending good vibes... please receive them
We promise it’s not stuck. Okay, maybe a little
Finding Nemo. He’s harder to locate than you think
Testing the server’s patience... and yours
Loading... we’re as confused as you are
We could blame this on your internet, but we won’t
Wait a sec, Googling how to load stuff
Okay, who spilled coffee on the server again ?
Loading… trying to remember why we’re here
Please enjoy this awkward silence while we load
Please wait while we overthink everything
Pretending we’re doing something important...
Our server is overthinking this too
Connecting the dots... badly
We don’t actually know what we’re doing, but we’re trying
Inventing a new color. Almost there... or not
Figuring out how to open a bag of chips quietly
Fighting a ninja. You probably can’t see them
