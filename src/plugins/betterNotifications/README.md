# Better Notifications

tired of hearing the same ping from your boss and your gaming buddies? yeah, me too.

this lets you set different notification sounds per user or server. upload whatever audio file you want.

## what it does

- custom sounds for specific people (by user id or display name)
- custom sounds for servers
- wildcard `*` if you want a default for all dms/servers
- volume control per sound
- just upload mp3/wav/ogg files and you're good

## how the priority works

**for servers:** specific server → wildcard `*` → discord's default

**for dms:** user id → display name → wildcard `*` → discord's default
