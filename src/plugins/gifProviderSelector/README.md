# GifProviderSelector

GifProviderSelector is a Vencord plugin that allows you to customize the GIF search provider within Discord. You can choose between several popular services, providing a more versatile search experience or preparing for future changes in Discord's default integrations.

## Features

- **Multiple Providers:** Switch between Discord's default, Klipy, Tenor, and Giphy.
- **Dynamic UI:** Automatically updates the search bar placeholder to reflect your chosen provider.
- **Future-Proofing:** Includes support for Klipy, the recommended successor to Tenor, which is scheduled for discontinuation in mid-2026.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works directly within the existing Discord GIF picker UI.

## Why Klipy?

Tenor's current integration is expected to be phased out by June 30th, 2026. Klipy was created by former Tenor employees and is designed to be a robust and familiar alternative, making it the highly recommended choice for users who prefer the Tenor-style search experience.

## Usage

1. Enable the **GifProviderSelector** plugin in your Vencord settings.
2. Open the plugin settings to select your desired GIF provider.
3. Use the Discord GIF picker as usual; searches will now be routed through your selected provider.
