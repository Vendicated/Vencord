# Summaries

Enables Discord's experimental Summaries feature on every server, displaying AI generated summaries of conversations.

Read more about summaries in the [official Discord help article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12926016807575-In-Channel-Conversation-Summaries)!

Note that this plugin can't fetch old summaries, it can only display ones created while your Discord is running with the plugin enabled.
