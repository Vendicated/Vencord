# ChatPopouts

Pop out any channel/DM/thread into its own window. Preserves your Discord session (no re-login) and hides sidebars in the pop-out for a focused chat view.

## Features

* Toolbar button in the channel header: **Open in pop-out**
* Context-menu entry on channels/DMs/threads: **Pop out chat**
* Pop-outs reuse the main window’s session (no auth prompts).
* Auto-hide guild/member sidebars in the pop-out.

## Usage

* **Toolbar button**: Click the external-arrow icon in the channel header.
* **Right-click** a channel/DM/thread → **Pop out chat**.
