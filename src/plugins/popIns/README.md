# PopIn's Plugin

The **PopIn's** Vencord plugin adds custom Pop-Out windows for each video, and give a possibility to watch two streams at the same time at fullscreen on two different monitors.



**Note:** This plugin requires [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) to function.

### Custom Pop-In Windows
-   **Independent Pop Out's**: Create separate Pop-In cards for each stream or webcam video source.
-   **Adjustable**: Pop-In windows are draggable, movable, and resizable.
-   **Main Window Constraint**: Due to technical limitations, these windows cannot be moved outside the main Discord window.
-   **Fullscreen Mode**: Maximize any Pop-In to view content in fullscreen.
-   **Native Functionality**: This plugin operates alongside Discord's default pop-out functionality. Original pop-out functionality will be preserved.

### Double Stream/Webcam Fullscreen
Allows you to view two different streams in fullscreen mode simultaneously on separate monitors.

**How to use:**

1.  **Open Native Pop-out**: Start by opening the native Discord pop-out window for your call or stream as you normally would.
2.  **Select Second Stream**: Right-click on the specific stream you wish to display on your second monitor.
3.  **Activate Pop-In**: Select **"Pop Out Stream"** from the context menu. The stream will appear as a Pop-In window within the main Discord client.
4.  **Enter Fullscreen**: Double-click the new Pop-In window to expand it to fullscreen on one of your monitors.
5.  **Primary Stream setup**: Return to the native pop-out window (on your second monitor) and set your first stream to fullscreen as usual.

You now have two different streams running in fullscreen on two separate monitors!
