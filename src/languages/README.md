This is not official but working (maybe there are bugs, but I did not find) version of Vencord. Russian translation was added and in the Vecncord settings you can select the language. The languages ​​directory was added here, a new language selection tab in the settings, the contents of the tabs were translated. In the future, I plan to add translation to all plugins (I have already started developing the mechanics). I hope this version gets into the official repository.
